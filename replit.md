# Telegram Email Bot

## Overview

This is a Telegram bot application that provides wallet security alert functionality through integration with the Brevo API. The bot sends unrecognized login alerts to digital asset holders to protect their cryptocurrency and wallet accounts. The system is built with Python using the python-telegram-bot library and features a modular architecture with separate components for client management, email services, and bot interaction.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

**Core Architecture Pattern**: Service-oriented design with separate modules for different functionalities
- **Bot Layer**: Handles Telegram interactions and command processing
- **Service Layer**: Manages email operations and external API integration
- **Data Layer**: Handles client data persistence and management
- **Configuration Layer**: Centralized configuration management

**Technology Stack**:
- Python 3.x as the primary runtime
- python-telegram-bot library for Telegram integration
- Brevo API for email delivery
- JSON files for data persistence
- HTML templates for email formatting

## Key Components

### 1. Telegram Bot Interface (`telegram_bot.py`)
- **Purpose**: Main bot interface handling user commands and interactions
- **Key Features**: Command routing, user authentication, message handling
- **Commands Supported**: /start, /help, /add_client, /list_clients, /remove_client, /send_email, /templates, /stats

### 2. Client Management System (`client_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages client database operations
- **Features**: Client CRUD operations, email validation, data persistence
- **Storage**: JSON-based file storage with automatic backup

### 3. Email Service (`email_service.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles email delivery through Brevo API
- **Features**: Rate limiting, template loading, API integration
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable emails per minute per user

### 4. Configuration Management (`config.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration using environment variables
- **Features**: API keys, file paths, rate limits, admin settings
- **Security**: Environment variable-based configuration for sensitive data

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User sends commands via Telegram
2. **Command Processing**: Bot receives and routes commands to appropriate handlers
3. **Client Operations**: Client data is managed through ClientManager with JSON persistence
4. **Email Operations**: Email requests are processed through EmailService with Brevo API
5. **Template Processing**: HTML templates are loaded and processed for email content
6. **Response**: Results are sent back to user via Telegram

## External Dependencies

### Primary Integrations
- **Telegram Bot API**: For bot functionality and user interaction
- **Brevo API**: For email delivery service (SMTP alternative)

### Required Environment Variables
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Bot authentication token
- `BREVO_API_KEY`: Email service API key
- `DEFAULT_SENDER_EMAIL`: Default sender email address
- `DEFAULT_SENDER_NAME`: Default sender name
- `EMAIL_RATE_LIMIT`: Rate limiting configuration
- `MAX_CLIENTS_PER_USER`: User limitation settings
- `ADMIN_USER_IDS`: Administrative user configuration

### Python Dependencies
- `python-telegram-bot`: Telegram integration
- `requests`: HTTP client for API calls
- `python-dotenv`: Environment variable management

## Deployment Strategy

**Local Development**:
- File-based JSON storage for rapid development
- Environment variable configuration via .env files
- Logging to both file and console

**Production Considerations**:
- Data directory structure with automatic creation
- Error handling and logging for production stability
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Admin user controls for management functions

**File Structure**:
```
/data/
  - clients.json (client database)
  - email_log.json (email tracking)
/templates/
  - welcome_email.html
  - notification_email.html
```

**Scalability Notes**:
- Current JSON-based storage is suitable for small to medium deployments
- Can be migrated to database systems (like Postgres with Drizzle) for larger scale
- Modular design allows easy component replacement

**Security Features**:
- Environment variable-based configuration
- Input validation for email addresses
- Rate limiting protection
- Admin user restrictions
