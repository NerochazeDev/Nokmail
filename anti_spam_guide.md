# Anti-Spam Email Configuration Guide for WalletSecure

## Current Implementation ✅

### 1. Email Content Optimization
- **Dual Format**: Both HTML and plain text versions sent
- **Clean Templates**: Professional design without spam triggers
- **Proper Headers**: X-Mailer, List-Unsubscribe, Reply-To headers
- **Clear Branding**: Consistent WalletSecure branding throughout
- **Unsubscribe Links**: Clear opt-out mechanism in every email

### 2. Sender Authentication (Brevo Handles)
- **DKIM Signing**: Brevo automatically signs emails
- **SPF Records**: Brevo's infrastructure is SPF-compliant
- **Return-Path**: Properly configured through Brevo

## Required DNS Configuration 🔧

### For walletsecure.detect@aol.com (AOL Email)
Since you're using an AOL email address, Brevo will handle most authentication. However, for better deliverability:

1. **Verify Domain in Brevo**:
   - Log into your Brevo account
   - Go to "Senders & IP" > "Domains"
   - Add your domain if you have one (optional)

2. **Use Dedicated IP** (Recommended for high volume):
   - Upgrade to Brevo Business plan for dedicated IP
   - This prevents sharing reputation with other senders

### If You Have a Custom Domain (Future Enhancement)
```dns
; SPF Record
@ IN TXT "v=spf1 include:spf.brevo.com ~all"

; DKIM Record (Brevo provides)
mail._domainkey IN CNAME mail.dkim.brevo.com

; DMARC Record
_dmarc IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com"
```

## Brevo Account Optimization 📧

### 1. Sender Reputation Settings

### 2. List Management
