# Wallet Security Email Deliverability Improvements

## Changes Made to Improve Inbox Delivery

### 1. Email Template Improvements
- **Professional wallet security template**: Clean, minimal design that resembles legitimate financial service notifications
- **WalletSecure branding**: Focused on digital asset security platform messaging
- **Removed spam triggers**: Eliminated excessive styling, bright colors, and suspicious language

### 2. Email Headers Optimization
- **List-Unsubscribe**: Proper unsubscribe functionality for legitimate bulk email
- **Feedback-ID**: Helps email providers identify the sender type as wallet security notifications
- **X-Entity-ID**: Identifies WalletSecure as the business sending emails
- **Normal Priority**: Avoids high priority flagging that triggers spam filters

### 3. Subject Line Changes
- **Before**: "Unrecognized Login Attempt to Your Wallet" (sounds phishing-like)
- **After**: "Security Alert: New login from [Location]" (sounds like legitimate financial service notification)

### 4. Content Improvements
- **Plain text version**: Added for better deliverability
- **Professional security tone**: Legitimate wallet security language
- **Financial service structure**: Follows patterns used by banks and financial institutions

### 5. Deliverability Best Practices
- **Wallet security focus**: Clear purpose as digital asset protection service
- **Bulk email compliance**: Added proper bulk email headers
- **Unsubscribe options**: Clear unsubscribe mechanisms

## Usage
The bot now uses the `wallet_security_alert` template by default, which should have much better inbox delivery rates as it follows legitimate financial security notification patterns.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test emails with different providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
2. Check spam folder initially, then mark as "Not Spam" to improve sender reputation
3. Monitor delivery rates over time as sender reputation improves
