# Email Deliverability Improvements

## Changes Made to Improve Inbox Delivery

### 1. Email Template Improvements
- **Facebook-style security template**: Clean, minimal design that resembles legitimate service notifications
- **Simple notification template**: Professional appearance similar to Gmail/Google notifications
- **Removed spam triggers**: Eliminated excessive styling, bright colors, and suspicious language

### 2. Email Headers Optimization
- **List-Unsubscribe**: Proper unsubscribe functionality for legitimate bulk email
- **Feedback-ID**: Helps email providers identify the sender type
- **X-Entity-ID**: Identifies the business sending emails
- **Normal Priority**: Avoids high priority flagging that triggers spam filters

### 3. Subject Line Changes
- **Before**: "Unrecognized Login Attempt to Your Wallet" (sounds phishing-like)
- **After**: "New login from [Location]" (sounds like legitimate service notification)

### 4. Content Improvements
- **Plain text version**: Added for better deliverability
- **Professional tone**: Removed aggressive security language
- **Legitimate structure**: Follows patterns used by Facebook, Google, and other trusted services

### 5. Deliverability Best Practices
- **Proper sender reputation**: Using consistent sender name and email
- **Bulk email compliance**: Added proper bulk email headers
- **Unsubscribe options**: Clear unsubscribe mechanisms

## Usage
The bot now uses the `facebook_style_security` template by default, which should have much better inbox delivery rates compared to the previous template.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test emails with different providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
2. Check spam folder initially, then mark as "Not Spam" to improve sender reputation
3. Monitor delivery rates over time as sender reputation improves
